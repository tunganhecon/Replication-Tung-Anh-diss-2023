# Replication-Tung-Anh-diss-2023

This replication package includes the data cleaning process in Stata to obtain the transitions required for the calibration process of the theoretical model presented in the dissertation and the MATLAB code for drawing the figures. Please note that due to the code for solving the model being privately distributed, it cannot be included in this repository. 

The data can be obtained from the following sources: 

1. The Consumer Population Survey (CPS) Basic Monthly Data: available on the Census website: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html
2. The Composite HWI Help-Wanted index by Barnichon (2010), available on the author's website
3. The unemployment rate series (UNRATE), obtained from FRED
